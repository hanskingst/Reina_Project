This is the installation guidance for the backend and the frontend.

once you clone the repository using:
git clone https://github.com/hanskingst/Reina_Project.git

Backend:
navigate to the reina_backend folder using: cd reina_backend and run:
pip install -r requirements.txt,
then to run the backend server use:
uvicorn main:app --reload

that will install every dependency for the backend.


Frontend:
After the repo is cloned ensure you have node and npm installed navigate to the reina_frontend using:
cd reina_frontend,
then run: npm install,
then to run the frontend server use:
npm run dev


After that you are good to open the browser and enter the link from your frontend terminal it will be 
somthing like: http://localhost:5173


Note: in the same ide open two terminals if you are using vs code one to run the backend server, and the 
other to run the front end server.
